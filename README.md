# e-learning-forntend-interns-project


Frontend interns team exercise project developed during a summer internship in 2022.

As a part of the team, I was responsible for implementing **ngx-translate** and developing the **"dashboard"** and **"user" components** with corresponding dependent components, interfaces, API services and dialogs.
